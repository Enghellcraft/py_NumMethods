# These are calculator methods, two other method could be: https://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-Inverse-of-a-3x3-Matrix
# a) Transpose the matrix: (practical but takes a lot of time in larger matrices)
#    I)  Check the determinant of the matrix, needs to be different than zero
#   II)  Transpose the original matrix. 
#  III)  Find the determinant of each of the 2x2 minor matrices.   
#   IV)  Create the matrix of cofactors. Place the results of the previous step into a new matrix of cofactors 
#        by aligning each minor matrix determinant with the corresponding position in the original matrix.
#        When assigning signs, the first element of the first row keeps its original sign. The second element is reversed. 
#        The third element keeps its original sign. Continue on with the rest of the matrix in this fashion. Note that the 
#        (+) or (-) signs in the checkerboard diagram do not suggest that the final term should be positive or negative. 
#        They are indicators of keeping (+) or reversing (-) whatever sign the number originally had.
#    V)  Divide each term of the adjugate matrix by the determinant 
#
# b) Using Linear Row Reduction to Find the Inverse Matrix: (powerful for any kind o matrix but not for humans)
#    I) Adjoin the identity matrix to the original matrix. 
#   II) Perform linear row reduction operations. Your objective is to create the identity matrix on the left side of this 
#       newly augmented matrix.
